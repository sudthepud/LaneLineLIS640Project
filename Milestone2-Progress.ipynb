    "We decided to completely switch our dataset to the TuSimple lane lines dataset. The reason for this is because we found that our roboflow datasets we were using before were not uniform at all in the labelling, while the TuSimple dataset provided 10000+ images with consistent labelling. So our DataLoader consists of the TuSimple dataset, where the labels are a binary mask (white or black) over an image indicating where the lane lines are. We decrease the size of each image heavily down to 512x256 to make the dataset more manageable and also implemented a amount of dataset used percentage to control how much of the 10000 images we actually use since training on all 10000 images is very time consuming. To get the TuSimple dataset formatted and set up into a DataLoader, we took inspiration from this project we found (https://github.com/IrohXu/lanenet-lane-detection-pytorch) and learned how they modified the TuSimple dataset and what transformations they applied to make the data better for training. They also implemented data shuffling so that each epoch sees the data in a different order, which we thought would be a good idea so we implemented that into our DataLoader as well. We then created a dictionary with our train and test DataLoader for ease of accessing while training and testing the model."

We found that deeper networks made training way more time consuming without giving us much benefit in performance of the final model, and we also found that Dropout did help with overfitting and slightly improved inference of our model, but only when we trained the model on a larger portion of the dataset, so we added Dropout. We also found that BatchNorm did not make a big difference. We found that the best learning rate was in the range of 0.001 to 0.004. We also implemented early stopping by keeping track of each epoch's loss on validation and stopping if the loss is worse than the previous 5 epochs. We hope to use the extension to mess around with different things more, since our biggest limitation has been time to train.\n"

    "The hyperparameter search was somewhat helpful, but we think we weren’t able to harness a lot of the potential benefits due to the significant training times when running the Optuna trials – even with only using a small percentage (5-10%) of the data. While increasing the number of trials did yield hyperparameters that improved results, we could not increase the number of trials by a significant amount. Additionally, we found the pruning feature on the Optuna website and found it to be useful in cutting off less promising trials early, which allowed us to bump up the number of trials. We plan to look into potentially using cloud compute so we can run more, longer trials for the hyperparameter search."
